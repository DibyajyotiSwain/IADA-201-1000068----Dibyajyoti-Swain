# MindPatch – AI-Assisted Digital Detox & Wellness Planner 🌿

MindPatch is a user-centered, AI-assisted digital wellness application prototype designed to help students and young adults manage screen time, reduce anxiety, and build healthy daily habits. The app focuses on emotional balance, mindful technology usage, and positive habit formation through gentle nudges and a calm, minimal interface.

This project was developed as part of the **Critical and Creative Thinking – Summative Assessment** under the **Artificial Intelligence** course.

## 📌 Project Purpose

In a highly connected digital world, students often experience screen fatigue, emotional stress, and burnout. MindPatch addresses this issue by combining:

- Mood awareness  
- Screen-time reflection  
- AI-based detox planning  
- Habit tracking with rewards  

The goal is to **support balance, not enforce restriction**.

## 🧠 Key Features

### 1. Mood Check-In  
Users log how they feel using emoji-based sliders. Mood check-ins occur periodically (every 12 hours) to build emotional awareness and personalize suggestions.

### 2. Screen-Time Dashboard  
Users manually input daily screen time.  
Optional permission-based access to screen-time data is **conceptual and simulated**, ensuring ethical and privacy-safe design.

### 3. AI Detox Planner  
The AI planner generates wellness suggestions based on:
- Mood level  
- Screen time  
- Time of day  
- User patterns  

**Example suggestions include:**
- Tech breaks  
- Breathing exercises  
- Hobby focus  
- Light motivational or entertainment content  

_No real AI model is built; logic is simulated using flow-based rules._

### 4. Gratitude Journal  
A calm journaling space for users to write daily positives, encouraging reflection and emotional grounding.

### 5. Habit Tracker & Rewards  
Users follow anxiety-reduction and maintenance habits such as:
- Mindfulness or breathing exercises  
- Reduced screen time before sleep  
- Physical activity  
- Gratitude journaling  

Progress is shown as a **monthly completion path**.  
🎁 **100% completion unlocks a simulated 12-month gym membership redeem code** (e.g., fitness apps like Cult-style platforms).

### 6. Personal Goals (Private)  
Users can set personal goals that remain private, supporting intrinsic motivation without social pressure.

## 🎨 Design Approach

- Soft pastel color palette (lavender, light blue, white)  
- Rounded UI components  
- Minimal text and low cognitive load  
- Emotionally supportive visuals  
- Accessibility-focused spacing and typography  

---

## 🤖 AI Logic Simulation

The AI behavior is rule-based and simulated.

### Example Logic:
- If mood < 3 AND screen time > 4 hours  
  → Suggest a 20-minute detox break  

Over time, the system adapts to:
- Mood trends  
- Time-of-day usage  
- Habit consistency  

This demonstrates ethical AI thinking without implementing live models.

## 🧪 Testing & Iteration

The prototype was tested with peer users.

### Feedback Highlights:
- Interface feels calm and non-judgmental  
- Mood logging is intuitive  
- Detox suggestions feel supportive, not controlling  

### Iterations Made:
- Simplified AI planner text  
- Improved button visibility  
- Reduced information overload
